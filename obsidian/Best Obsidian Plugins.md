# Best Obsidian Plugins

Obsidian ships with some core plugins (features), and the editor is extensible to 3rd parties to make their own **Community Plugins**.  This note captures the plugins I find most useful.

## [Advanced Canvas](obsidian://show-plugin?id=advanced-canvas)
This plugin enhances the Obsidian canvas with a wide array of features
## [Calendar](obsidian://show-plugin?id=calendar)
Creates a simple Calendar view for visualizing and navigating between your daily notes
## [Omnisearch](obsidian://show-plugin?id=omnisearch)
Intelligent search for your notes.
## [Tasks](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin)
Track tasks across your entire vault.
