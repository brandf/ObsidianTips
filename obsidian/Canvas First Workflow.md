# Canvas First Workflow

I use canvas as primary main editor so I can **organize information spatially**.

Each of my projects has a [[ObsidianTips Canvas.canvas|Canvas]] at the root, and I mainly use embedded notes to store content.  This keeps the markdown independently useful, and the Canvas as an optional view.
