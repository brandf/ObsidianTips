# Best Obsidian Plugins

Obsidian ships with some core plugins (features), and the editor is extensible to 3rd parties to make their own [Community Plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins).  This note captures the plugins I find most useful.

## [Omnisearch](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=omnisearch)
Intelligent search for your notes.
## [Tasks](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin)
