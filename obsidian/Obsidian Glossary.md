# Obsidian Glossary

A comprehensive reference of terms and concepts used in [[AboutObsidian|Obsidian]] and throughout this digital garden. Perfect for beginners or as a quick reference.

## Core Concepts

### Vault
A **vault** is a folder on your computer containing your markdown notes. See [[How Obsidian Works#The Vault|How Obsidian Works]] for details.

- Just a regular folder with `.md` files
- Contains a hidden `.obsidian/` folder for settings
- Can have any name and live anywhere on your system
- You can have multiple vaults for different purposes
- Example: `Documents/MyNotes/` is a vault if opened in Obsidian

**Related:** [[My Personal Vault|Personal vault patterns]], [[One Vault to Rule Them All|master vault]]

### Note
A **note** is a single markdown file (`.md`) in your vault.

- Contains text, links, images, etc.
- Can be edited in Obsidian or any text editor
- Stored as plain text with markdown formatting
- Named with the file name (e.g., `My Note.md`)
- Can be organized in folders or kept flat

**Related:** [[Getting Started with Obsidian#Step 4 Create Your First Note|Creating notes]]

### Markdown
**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language for formatting text using plain characters.

Common syntax:
- `# Heading` - Creates headings
- `**bold**` - Bold text
- `*italic*` - Italic text
- `[link](url)` - External links
- `![image](path)` - Images
- `- item` - Bullet lists

## Linking & Connections

### Wikilink
A **wikilink** is Obsidian's internal linking format using double brackets: `[[Note Name]]`

- Links to other notes in your vault
- Creates bidirectional connections
- Can link to specific sections: `[[Note#Heading]]`
- Can use aliases: `[[Note|Display Text]]`
- Red/gray color indicates note doesn't exist yet

**Related:** [[How Obsidian Works - Details#Links|How links work]]

### Backlink
A **backlink** is an automatic reverse reference showing which notes link to the current note.

- Appears in right sidebar under "Backlinks"
- Updates automatically when links are created/removed
- Enables bidirectional navigation
- Core feature that makes Obsidian powerful
- No manual maintenance required

**Related:** [[How Obsidian Works - Details#Bidirectional Linking|Bidirectional linking]]

### Embed
An **embed** displays the content of another note or file inline using `![[Note]]`

- `![[Another Note]]` - Embeds entire note
- `![[Note#Section]]` - Embeds specific section
- `![[image.png]]` - Embeds image
- Content is live - edits appear everywhere it's embedded
- Used heavily in [[Canvas First Workflow|canvas]]

**Related:** [[How Obsidian Works - Details#Link Variations|Link variations]]

### MOC (Map of Content)
A **MOC** is an index note that links to related notes about a topic.

- Acts as a hub for a subject area

- Helps navigate large vaults
- Can be hierarchical (MOCs linking to MOCs)
- Alternative to strict folder hierarchies

Example:
```markdown
# Web Development MOC

## Frontend
