# About Obsidian

Obsidian is a powerful, free note-taking application that treats your notes as a knowledge base. Unlike traditional note-taking apps, Obsidian focuses on creating connections between your thoughts, building a personal Wikipedia of linked ideas.

## What Makes Obsidian Different?

Obsidian is built on three fundamental principles that set it apart from other note-taking tools (see [[Why Obsidian]] for the philosophy):

### 1. Local-First & Private

Your notes live on your device as plain markdown files. This means:
- **Complete privacy** - Your thoughts stay on your computer
- **Offline access** - No internet required to work
- **Fast performance** - No server lag or syncing delays
- **Your data, your control** - No vendor lock-in

This approach is central to [[How Obsidian Works]] - it's really just a sophisticated markdown editor at its core.

### 2. Interconnected Knowledge

Obsidian excels at creating relationships between ideas through [[How Obsidian Works - Details#Links|wikilinks]]. Every time you connect two notes, you're building a web of knowledge that mirrors how your brain actually works. The [[How Obsidian Works - Details#Graph|graph view]] visualizes these connections, revealing patterns and relationships you might not have noticed.

### 3. Infinitely Extensible

With [[Best Obsidian Plugins|thousands of community plugins]] and a robust API, you can customize Obsidian to match your exact workflow. Whether you need task management, calendar integration, or [[Using AI with Obsidian|AI-powered assistance]], there's likely a plugin for it (see [[How Obsidian Works - Details#Plugins|plugin ecosystem]]).

## Key Features

**Markdown-Based**
All notes are stored as plain markdown files that you can read in any text editor. This ensures [[Why Obsidian|your knowledge lasts]] - no proprietary formats, no data lock-in.

**Wikilinks & Backlinks**
Create bidirectional connections between notes using `[[double brackets]]`. Every link automatically creates a backlink, showing you all the notes that reference the current one. Learn more about [[How Obsidian Works - Details#Links|how links work]].

**Canvas for Spatial Thinking**
The [[Canvas First Workflow|Canvas feature]] provides an infinite workspace where you can arrange notes, images, and ideas spatially - perfect for brainstorming and visual thinking. See more at [[How Obsidian Works - Details#Canvas|Canvas details]].

**Graph View**
Visualize your entire knowledge base as an interactive network graph. The [[How Obsidian Works - Details#Graph|graph view]] helps you discover unexpected connections and understand the structure of your thinking.

**Version Control Friendly**
Because notes are just markdown files, they work perfectly with Git and GitHub. This enables [[Using Obsidian with GitHub|powerful workflows for collaboration, versioning, and backup]].

**Flexible Organization**
Organize notes using folders, tags, or links - or all three. Many users adopt approaches like [[My Personal Vault|personal vault structures]] or the [[One Vault to Rule Them All|master vault pattern]] to manage multiple projects.

**Publish Your Knowledge**
Share your notes with the world by [[Exporting to the Web|publishing to the web]] using tools like Quartz, or use Obsidian's official Publish service.

## Common Use Cases

**Personal Knowledge Management**
Build a [[My Personal Vault|second brain]] that grows with you. Capture ideas, organize research, and connect concepts across all areas of your life.

**Project Documentation**
Many developers keep an [[Using Obsidian with GitHub|obsidian folder in each GitHub project]] for documentation that lives alongside the code and can be version-controlled.

**Writing & Research**
Writers use Obsidian to organize research notes, develop characters, plot story arcs, and draft manuscripts with cross-referenced worldbuilding.

**Learning & Study**
Students create connected note systems that help them understand relationships between concepts, making studying more effective.

**Daily Journaling**
Track your daily thoughts, activities, and reflections while linking to relevant projects, people, and ideas throughout your vault.
