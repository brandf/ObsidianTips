## Quick Capture Workflows

The key to effective mobile use is optimizing for quick capture rather than extensive writing.

### Using Share Sheet (iOS)

The iOS share sheet is one of the most powerful quick capture tools:

**Setup:**
1. In Obsidian settings â†’ Core plugins â†’ enable "Quick Capture"
2. Configure your default capture note location
3. Optional: Create a capture template

**Capturing from anywhere:**
- Share text, links, or images to Obsidian
- Adds content directly to your capture note
- Include automatic timestamps if desired
- Process captured items later from desktop

**Best practices:**
- Set a dedicated "Inbox" note for captures
- Review and process captured items daily
- Use simple formatting that mobile handles well

### Share Functionality (Android)

Android's share functionality works similarly:
- Share to Obsidian from any app
- Appends to a designated capture note
- Can include URLs, text, and images
- Requires enabling Quick Capture plugin

### Quick Note Creation

**Mobile-optimized creation:**
- Use the "+" button or quick action
- Start with templates for consistency
- Keep initial structure simple
- Add metadata later from desktop

**Keyboard shortcuts (with external keyboard):**
- `Cmd/Ctrl + N` - New note
- `Cmd/Ctrl + O` - Open quick switcher
- `Cmd/Ctrl + E` - Toggle edit/preview

### Voice-to-Text Capture

Mobile excels at voice input:

**iOS dictation:**
- Tap microphone on keyboard
- Speak naturally with punctuation ("period", "comma")
- Works in any text field
- No special Obsidian configuration needed

**Android voice input:**
- Tap microphone on keyboard
- Use Gboard or other voice-enabled keyboards
- Similar punctuation commands
- Generally accurate for quick capture

**Best practices:**
- Review and clean up voice transcriptions later
- Use voice for quick thoughts, not polished writing
- Add proper formatting on desktop
- Consider creating "voice note" tag for later cleanup

### Templates on Mobile

Templates work on mobile but with limitations:

**What works:**
- Basic template insertion
- Core Templates plugin
- Simple variable substitution
- Date/time variables

**Limitations:**
- Complex Templater scripts may not work
- JavaScript-heavy templates can fail
- Some dynamic content may not render

**Mobile-optimized templates:**

```markdown
---
created: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}
tags: mobile-capture
---

# {{title}}

## Quick Notes


## Follow-up
- [ ] Process on desktop

```

**Template strategy:**
- Keep mobile templates simple
- Use basic variables only
- Create separate "mobile" versions of complex templates
- Test templates on mobile before relying on them

## Mobile-Optimized Vault Organization

Mobile devices demand simpler navigation structures.

### Simpler Folder Structures

**Desktop approach:**
```
Project/
  Meetings/
    2024/
      Q1/
        January/
```

**Mobile-friendly approach:**
```
Projects/
Meetings/
Archive/
Inbox/
```

**Principles:**
- Reduce nesting depth (2-3 levels max)
- Use wider, flatter structures
- Rely on tags and links instead of folders
- Keep frequently-accessed notes at top level

### MOCs as Navigation

Map of Contents (MOCs) are especially valuable on mobile:

**Example MOC for mobile:**

```markdown
# ðŸ“± Mobile Hub

## Quick Access
- [[Daily Notes Workflow|Today's Note]]
- [[Inbox]] - Process captures
- [[Weekly Review]]

## Active Projects
- [[Project A Hub]]
- [[Project B Hub]]

## Reference
- [[Contacts MOC]]
- [[Resources MOC]]

## Templates
- [[Meeting Template]]
- [[Quick Note Template]]
```

**Benefits:**
- Single tap to main navigation
- No folder hunting
- Visual organization
- Easy to update

### Pinned Notes

Both iOS and Android support note pinning:

**Pin these types of notes:**
- Daily note template or today's note
- Main navigation MOC
- Inbox/capture note
- Current priority project
- Reading list

**Accessing pinned notes:**
- Show in file list at top
- Quick access from file explorer
- Available in quick switcher
