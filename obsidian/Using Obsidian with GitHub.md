# Using Obsidian with GitHub

Obsidian is mainly just a front-end to standard markdown, so GitHub is a great way to version your notes, and share/collaborate on projects/documentation.

I use a convention where I have an 'obsidian' folder at the root of the GitHub project that can be opened as an Obsidian vault.
