# Migrating to Obsidian

Switching note-taking systems is daunting, but Obsidian's plain-text markdown format makes it one of the most migration-friendly options. This guide covers practical strategies for moving from popular platforms.

## General Migration Principles

### Before You Start

**Critical questions to answer:**

1. **Why are you migrating?** (Clarity prevents regret mid-migration)
2. **What must come with you?** (Active notes vs. archives)
3. **Can you tolerate a hybrid approach?** (Keep old system read-only)
4. **How much time can you dedicate?** (Full vs. gradual migration)

### The Three Migration Strategies

**1. Cold Turkey (Full Migration)**
- Export everything, convert all at once, switch completely
- ‚úÖ Clean break, forces commitment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è High upfront time investment, disruptive

**2. Gradual Migration (Recommended)**
- Move active notes first, old system becomes read-only archive
- ‚úÖ Less disruptive, test Obsidian with real work
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Maintaining two systems temporarily

**3. Fresh Start**
- Start new notes in Obsidian, reference old system as needed
- ‚úÖ Minimal migration effort, cleanest vault
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Knowledge fragmentation

**Most people find gradual migration the sweet spot.**

### What to Expect

**Reality check:**
- üî¥ Not everything will convert perfectly
- üî¥ Some formatting will break
- üî¥ Proprietary features won't transfer (databases, embeds, etc.)
- üü¢ Plain text and images convert well
- üü¢ Link structure often translates
- üü¢ Markdown content is usually clean

**Plan for 20-30% post-migration cleanup time.**

## From Notion

Notion is one of the most common migration sources, but its proprietary features make this challenging.

### Export Process

1. **Workspace Settings** ‚Üí **Settings & Members**
2. **Export all workspace content**
3. Choose **Markdown & CSV** format
4. **Export** ‚Üí Downloads ZIP file
5. Extract ZIP to temporary folder

### What Exports Well

‚úÖ Basic text and headings
‚úÖ Simple tables (as CSV or markdown)
‚úÖ Images and attachments
‚úÖ Links between pages
‚úÖ Code blocks

### What Doesn't Export Well

‚ùå Databases (export as CSV, lose functionality)
‚ùå Inline databases (export as simple tables)
‚ùå Callouts (convert to `>` blockquotes)
‚ùå Toggle lists (become flat lists)
‚ùå Embedded content (links only)
‚ùå Comments and discussions
‚ùå Page relationships and properties

### Conversion Steps

**1. Initial Import**
```markdown
1. Extract Notion export ZIP
2. Copy all .md files to new Obsidian vault
3. Copy images to attachments folder
4. Open vault in Obsidian
```

**2. Fix File Structure**
- Notion exports with spaces in filenames (works fine, but optional to change)
- Notion creates UUID subfolders (flatten if desired)
- Move images to dedicated attachment folder

**3. Fix Notion-Specific Formatting**

**Callouts**: Notion exports callouts as plain blockquotes
```markdown
Notion export:
> üí° This is a callout

Convert to Obsidian callout:
> [!info]
> This is a callout
```

**Toggle lists**: Become regular headings, manually convert if needed

**Databases**: CSV exports need manual conversion
- Simple lists ‚Üí Bullet points
- Tables ‚Üí Markdown tables or Dataview
- Linked databases ‚Üí Create manual links or use Dataview

**4. Link Cleanup**

Notion exports links with URL encoding:
```markdown
Bad: [[Page%20With%20Spaces]]
Good: [[Page With Spaces]]
```

**Fix with Find & Replace:**
- Find: `%20`
- Replace: ` ` (space)

### Structure Adaptation

**Notion's hierarchy:**
```
Workspace ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Sub-pages ‚Üí Blocks
```

**Obsidian's approach:**
```
Vault ‚Üí Folders ‚Üí Notes ‚Üí Links
```

**Migration strategy:**
1. Top-level pages ‚Üí Folders or MOC notes
2. Sub-pages ‚Üí Individual notes in folders
3. Databases ‚Üí Tags + Dataview queries or manual indexes

### Post-Migration Notion Workflow

**Option 1**: Keep Notion read-only for reference
**Option 2**: Export databases as CSV, import to Dataview

**For databases**, consider:
- Simple task lists ‚Üí Obsidian Tasks plugin
- Content databases ‚Üí Dataview with frontmatter
- Reference tables ‚Üí Markdown tables with links

### Notion Migration Timeline

- **Day 1**: Export and initial import (2-4 hours)
- **Day 2-3**: Folder structure and file organization (3-5 hours)
- **Week 1**: Fix formatting and links (5-10 hours)
- **Week 2+**: Gradually clean up remaining issues as you use notes

## From Evernote

Evernote's export is more straightforward than Notion's, but has its own challenges.

### Export Process

1. **File** ‚Üí **Export Notes** (desktop app)
2. Select all notebooks or specific notebooks
3. Export format: **ENEX** (Evernote's XML format)
4. Save .enex files

### Converting ENEX to Markdown

**Option 1: Yarle (Recommended)**
```bash
npm install -g yarle
yarle --enex "path/to/export.enex" --output "path/to/obsidian/vault"
```

**Option 2: Obsidian Importer Plugin**
- Install **Obsidian Importer** community plugin
- Import ENEX files directly
- Handles attachments and basic formatting

**Option 3: Manual (not recommended for bulk)**

### Tag Migration

Evernote tags ‚Üí Obsidian tags (mostly direct translation)

```markdown
Evernote: work, project-alpha, important

Obsidian note frontmatter:
---
tags: [work, project-alpha, important]
---

Or inline: #work #project-alpha #important
```

**Decision point**: Frontmatter vs. inline tags vs. both?
- Frontmatter: Cleaner reading, better for Dataview
- Inline: More contextual, easier to add/remove
- Both: Most flexible, some redundancy

### What Converts Well

‚úÖ Note text and formatting
‚úÖ Tags
‚úÖ Images and attachments (with Yarle)
‚úÖ Note titles
‚úÖ Notebooks ‚Üí Can become folders

### What Doesn't Convert Well

‚ùå Note links (Evernote uses internal IDs)
‚ùå Web clipper metadata
‚ùå Reminders (convert to tasks manually)
‚ùå Notebooks as organization (you need to create folder structure)
‚ùå Saved searches (recreate in Obsidian)

### Post-Migration Cleanup

1. **Review folder structure**: Notebooks export flat, organize by topic/project
2. **Recreate note links**: Evernote links break‚Äîfind references and manually link
3. **Convert reminders**: Use Tasks plugin or Dataview
4. **Handle web clippings**: Decide to keep, summarize, or delete

### Evernote Migration Timeline

- **Day 1**: Export and convert (1-3 hours)
- **Day 2**: Import and initial organization (2-4 hours)
- **Week 1**: Tag review and folder structure (3-5 hours)
- **Ongoing**: Fix links as you encounter them

## From Roam Research

Roam users often find Obsidian familiar due to shared linking philosophy.

### Export Process

1. Click **‚ãØ** (three dots menu)
2. **Export All**
3. Choose **JSON** format
4. Download JSON file

### Converting JSON to Markdown

**Option 1: Roam-to-Obsidian Converter**
- Install **Markdown Importer** community plugin
- Supports Roam JSON import
- Handles block references with some limitations

**Option 2: Custom scripts**
- GitHub: `roam-to-git` or similar converters
- More control but requires technical knowledge

### Block Reference Conversion

This is the biggest challenge. Roam's block references don't directly translate.

**Roam block reference:**
```
((block-id-abc123))
```

**Obsidian options:**
1. **Embed blocks**: Use block IDs `![[note#^block-id]]`
2. **Regular links**: Convert to full note links
3. **Copy content**: For short blocks, just duplicate content

**Realistic approach**: Convert most block references to regular note links, manually handle critical block embeds.

### Daily Notes

Roam's daily notes are central; Obsidian has similar functionality.

**Migration:**
1. Enable Core **Daily Notes** plugin
2. Set date format to match Roam (often `YYYY-MM-DD`)
3. Move Roam daily notes to daily notes folder
4. Update templates

### Bidirectional Links

Both Roam and Obsidian support bidirectional links‚Äîthis transfers well!

```markdown
Roam: [[Note Name]]
Obsidian: [[Note Name]]
```

Direct translation, no changes needed.

### What Converts Well

‚úÖ Page links (wikilinks)
‚úÖ Daily notes
‚úÖ Tags
‚úÖ Basic markdown formatting
‚úÖ Code blocks
‚úÖ Images

### What Doesn't Convert Well

‚ùå Block references (require manual handling)
‚ùå Block embeds (need reconstruction)
‚ùå Queries (Roam queries ‚â† Dataview, must rewrite)
‚ùå Page attributes (convert to frontmatter)
‚ùå Namespaced pages (flatten or create folder structure)

### Roam Migration Timeline

- **Day 1**: Export and convert (1-2 hours)
- **Day 2**: Import and structure review (2-3 hours)
- **Week 1**: Block reference fixes, daily notes setup (3-5 hours)
- **Week 2+**: Query rewrites and ongoing adjustments

## From Apple Notes

Apple Notes is convenient but limited in export options.

### Export Process

**Challenge**: Apple Notes has no native bulk export to markdown.

**Option 1: Exporter App (Mac only)**
- Use third-party tool like **Exporter** or **CloudPull**
- Select notes and export to plain text or HTML
- Convert HTML to markdown manually or with Pandoc

**Option 2: Manual Copy-Paste**
- Open note in Apple Notes
- Copy content (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)
- Paste into Obsidian note
- Repeat for each note (tedious for large libraries)

**Option 3: Script-Based (Technical)**
```bash
# Using osascript to access Apple Notes database
# Search GitHub for "apple-notes-exporter" scripts
```

### Export Limitations

‚ùå No official bulk export
‚ùå Images embedded in proprietary format
‚ùå Attachments difficult to extract
‚ùå No link preservation
‚ùå Limited formatting in export

### Workarounds

**For images:**
1. Right-click image in Apple Notes
2. **Copy** or **Save Image**
3. Paste/save to Obsidian attachments folder
4. Link manually in markdown: `![[image.png]]`

**For tables:**
- Apple Notes tables export as plain text
- Reformat as markdown tables manually

### Realistic Approach

Given limitations, consider:
- **Gradual migration**: Only migrate active/important notes
- **Leave archive**: Keep Apple Notes as read-only reference
- **Fresh start**: Use migration as opportunity to review and rebuild

### Apple Notes Migration Timeline

- **Per note**: 2-5 minutes depending on complexity
- **100 notes**: 5-10 hours (with images/formatting)
- **Recommendation**: Migrate selectively, not exhaustively

## From OneNote

OneNote's organizational model differs significantly from Obsidian's flat structure.

### Export Process

**Challenge**: OneNote has no direct markdown export.

**Option 1: OneNote Batch Exporter Plugin**
1. Download community tool (search GitHub)
2. Export sections/notebooks to HTML or DOCX
3. Convert to markdown with Pandoc

**Option 2: Manual Export**
1. **File** ‚Üí **Export** in OneNote
2. Export as **PDF** or **Word Document**
3. Convert with Pandoc:
```bash
pandoc input.docx -t markdown -o output.md
```

**Option 3: Copy-Paste with Markdown Formatting**
- Use **Obsidian Web Clipper** to paste formatted text
- Preserves basic formatting

### What Doesn't Transfer

‚ùå Section organization (no equivalent)
‚ùå Embedded files (extract manually)
‚ùå Ink/drawing annotations (export as images)
‚ùå Audio/video recordings (save separately)
‚ùå Page templates (recreate in Obsidian)
‚ùå Tags (OneNote tags ‚â† Obsidian tags)

### Structure Adaptation

**OneNote hierarchy:**
```
Notebook ‚Üí Section Group ‚Üí Section ‚Üí Page ‚Üí Subpage
```

**Obsidian equivalent:**
```
Vault ‚Üí Folder ‚Üí Folder ‚Üí Note ‚Üí Heading/Link
```

**Migration strategy:**
1. Notebook ‚Üí Vault folder
2. Section ‚Üí Note or subfolder
3. Page ‚Üí Note
4. Subpage ‚Üí Linked note or heading in parent

### OneNote Migration Timeline

- **Day 1-2**: Export notebooks (varies widely)
- **Week 1**: Convert to markdown (5-15 hours)
- **Week 2**: Restructure and link notes (10-20 hours)
- **Reality**: OneNote migration is time-intensive

## Post-Migration Cleanup

Regardless of source system, expect cleanup work.

### Broken Links Audit

**Week 1 post-migration:**
1. Search for `[[]]` (empty links)
2. Use **Graph View** to find disconnected clusters
3. Fix or remove broken references

### Formatting Fixes

**Common issues:**
- Extra blank lines
- Inconsistent heading levels
- Code blocks without language tags
- Stray HTML from conversion
- Incorrect list formatting

**Tools to help:**
- **Linter** plugin: Auto-format according to rules
- Find & Replace: Batch fix patterns
- **Markdown Format Importer**: Normalize from various sources

### Link Consolidation

You may have duplicate concepts from old system:
```markdown
[[Project Alpha]]
[[project-alpha]]
[[Project_Alpha]]
```

**Fix:**
1. Choose canonical name: `[[Project Alpha]]`
2. Search for variations
3. Replace with canonical version
4. Delete duplicate notes

### Frontmatter Standardization

Converted notes may have inconsistent metadata:

```markdown
Before:
---
title: Some Note
date: 2024-01-15
category: work
---

Standardize to:
---
title: Some Note
created: 2024-01-15
tags: [work]
---
```

Use Find & Replace or Linter to normalize.

## Gradual vs Full Migration

### Full Migration

**When to choose:**
- Small library (<500 notes)
- Dissatisfied with current system
- Can afford 1-2 weeks of setup time
- Want clean break

**Process:**
1. Export everything
2. Convert in bulk
3. Import to Obsidian
4. Cleanup phase (2-3 weeks)
5. Close old system

### Gradual Migration

**When to choose:**
- Large library (>1000 notes)
- Can't afford disruption
- Uncertain about Obsidian
- Want to test workflow first

**Process:**
1. Set up Obsidian with templates/plugins
2. Start all NEW notes in Obsidian
3. Migrate frequently-used notes from old system
4. Leave archive in old system (read-only)
5. Migrate more over 3-6 months as needed

**Benefits:** Less pressure, learn Obsidian while migrating, only migrate what matters.

## What to Keep vs What to Leave Behind

### Migration is a Filter

Use this opportunity to curate your knowledge base.

**Questions to ask each note:**
- Have I referenced this in the last year?
- Is this still accurate/relevant?
- Does this spark ideas or just clutter?
- Would I be upset if I lost this?

### Categories to Consider

**‚úÖ Definitely migrate:**
- Active project notes
- Reference material you use regularly
- Core knowledge base
- Ongoing learning notes
- Templates and processes

**‚ö†Ô∏è Evaluate carefully:**
- Completed project notes (archive vs migrate?)
- Old meeting notes (summarize instead?)
- Duplicated web content (link instead?)
- Rough drafts (clean up first?)

**‚ùå Consider leaving behind:**
- Truly outdated content
- Notes you can't even remember creating
- Duplicates of published content
- Temporary/scratch notes
- Personal notes you've outgrown

### The 80/20 Rule

**Reality**: 80% of your value comes from 20% of your notes.

**Strategy**: Migrate the vital 20% with care, leave the rest as searchable archive in old system.

## Migration Checklist

### Pre-Migration
- [ ] Understand why you're migrating
- [ ] Choose migration strategy (full/gradual/fresh)
- [ ] Backup existing notes (always!)
- [ ] Set up Obsidian vault structure
- [ ] Install essential plugins
- [ ] Create templates for common note types

### During Migration
- [ ] Export from source system
- [ ] Convert to markdown
- [ ] Import to Obsidian
- [ ] Verify attachments transferred
- [ ] Initial link audit
- [ ] Test search and navigation

### Post-Migration
- [ ] Fix broken links (ongoing)
- [ ] Standardize formatting
- [ ] Add frontmatter where needed
- [ ] Reorganize folder structure if needed
- [ ] Set up templates and workflows
- [ ] Document your system
- [ ] Test backup/sync solution

### Week 2-4
- [ ] Review orphan notes
- [ ] Connect isolated clusters
- [ ] Refine folder structure
- [ ] Optimize plugins
- [ ] Final link cleanup

## Common Migration Mistakes

### 1. Trying to Migrate Everything

**Mistake**: Treating old system as sacred archive.
**Better**: Migrate what's valuable, leave the rest accessible but separate.

### 2. Not Testing First

**Mistake**: Migrating 5,000 notes before understanding Obsidian.
**Better**: Migrate 50 notes, use for a week, then proceed.

### 3. Ignoring Cleanup

**Mistake**: Import everything, never fix formatting/links.
**Better**: Schedule cleanup time, tackle systematically.

### 4. Over-Organizing Immediately

**Mistake**: Spending weeks creating perfect folder structure.
**Better**: Simple structure first, refine as usage patterns emerge.

### 5. Forgetting Backups

**Mistake**: Deleting old system immediately after migration.
**Better**: Keep old system read-only for 3-6 months minimum.

## Key Takeaways

‚úÖ Perfect migration is impossible‚Äîaim for "good enough"
‚úÖ Gradual migration often works better than full migration
‚úÖ Use migration as opportunity to curate and improve notes
‚úÖ Keep old system as read-only backup for months
‚úÖ Accept some manual cleanup work is inevitable
‚úÖ Test with small subset before bulk migration

**Remember**: The goal isn't to perfectly replicate your old system in Obsidian‚Äîit's to build a better knowledge management workflow. Don't let migration paralysis stop you from starting.
