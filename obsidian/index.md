## Key Concepts

Understanding these ideas will help you get the most from Obsidian:

**Local-First Philosophy**
Your notes are [[AboutObsidian#1. Local-First & Private|stored as plain markdown files]] on your computer. This means complete privacy, fast performance, and no vendor lock-in. See [[Why Obsidian|why this matters]].

**Bidirectional Linking**
Unlike traditional note apps, [[How Obsidian Works - Details#Links|Obsidian's wikilinks]] create automatic backlinks. When you link from Note A to Note B, Note B knows about it. This builds a true knowledge graph.

**Markdown Foundation**
Everything is [[How Obsidian Works|plain markdown]]. Your notes work in any text editor, integrate with [[Using Obsidian with GitHub|Git]], and can be processed by [[Using AI with Obsidian|AI tools]]. Obsidian just makes working with markdown delightful.

**Non-Hierarchical Organization**
Ideas don't fit neatly in folders. Obsidian lets you create [[How Obsidian Works - Details#Links|flexible networks of linked notes]] where concepts can relate to multiple areas simultaneously.

**Visual + Textual**
Combine the power of text-based notes with visual tools like [[How Obsidian Works - Details#Graph|graph view]] and [[Canvas First Workflow|canvas]] to see your knowledge from multiple perspectives.
