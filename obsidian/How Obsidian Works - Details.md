## How Obsidian Works

Think of Obsidian as a front-end to markdown files.  When you're editing notes, you're **editing standard markdown** that can be read in any viewer.

While editing documents, the details of markdown are hidden by default, but you can always drop into "Source mode" to edit directly.
## Links

Create connections between your notes. Link anything and everything — ideas, people, places, books, and beyond. Invent your own personal Wikipedia.

## Graph

Visualize the relationships between your notes. Find hidden patterns in your thinking through a visually engaging and interactive graph.

## Canvas
